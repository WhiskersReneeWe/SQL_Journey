# SQL Journey
A high-level course note on [**Data Wrangling, Analysis and AB Testing with SQL** ](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-wrangling-analysis-abtesting/home/welcome)

SQL dialect used in this course is Postgresql

# Summary on problem solving using SQL

* Dive right in with any rough ideas in mind
* It is important to dive in because getting familiar with different tables is one of the most crucial part of writing better queries to understand the problem one is trying to solve
* Start small with the inner most subqueries. Copy and paste each sub table into a safe place with clear document on what they do
* Break down differnt goals to sovle and document the reasoning of table joins


# Special Note

* This project is done on [Mode](https://mode.com/), which is so cool to use. They include features that are similar to Tableau which allows users to directly plot pretty things right after a query output
* This class provides me a super valuable opportunity to get to be a real data analyst who goes from creating SQL queries to build up useful intermediate tables to condict AB testing. This is special because not many online content provides such integral learning experience. 
* I will highly recommend this course to anyone who wants to master SQL starting as a total noob!
